## Vintage Online Store perl Source Code (ca. 1996)

I wrote my first online store with shopping cart in the mid-90's
using just the CGI spec from the old NCSA server, a dog-eared copy
of the Camel book, and a pile of perl scripts. At the time the only
"online stores" were Egghead.com and Internet.net. I spent a lot of
time reading the URL parameters of these two sites before I worked
out how to create a shopping cart of my own.

I wrote it just on a whim for the computer sales company I was
working for at the time. I had the store fully working and taking
orders -- it just needed to be kept up to date. The feedback I got
back from the owners at the time was, "Why are you making this? It's
just a fad. **Nobody will ever put their credit card number into the
Internet**." So the online store died on the vine.

I believed in the potential of the Internet though, so I kept at it.
15+ years later I'm still building web sites; now using the Ruby
language -- in many ways an evolution of the original perl language
I started out with.

This is the source code for that original online store. I just barely
understood perl at the time, and now that I look at it, it's
peppered with security holes. But I'm pretty sure that's how most
people were doing it at a time when it was just us early pioneers
trying to figure it all out.

[The last modified date on the file was May 29, 1996. If I recall
correctly, I started writing it in late 1994/early 1995, putting
in most of the work before I got married in mid-1995.]
